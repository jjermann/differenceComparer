state "Initial collection (C0)" as C0 #white: Initial collection

state "After modification 2 (C0M2)" as C0M2 #white: Initial collection after modification 2

state "Difference 1 (Diff0C1)" as Diff0C1 #lightgreen: Difference from initial collection
Diff0C1: to collection after modification 1

state "Difference 2 (Diff0C2)" as Diff0C2 #lightgreen: Difference from initial collection
Diff0C2: to collection after modification 2

state "Modification difference (DiffC1C2)" as DiffC1C2 #lightgreen: Difference from collection after modification 1
DiffC1C2: to collection after modification 2

state "Difference Progression (DiffP0C1C2)" as DiffP0C1C2 #lightblue: Difference progression from modification 1 to modification 2
DiffP0C1C2: (with initial collection as base)

C0 --> Diff0C1

Diff0C1 -> DiffP0C1C2
DiffP0C1C2 -> Diff0C2
C0 -[dashed]-> DiffP0C1C2
note on link
A difference progression always
has an implicit base collection.
end note
DiffP0C1C2 -[dashed]-> DiffC1C2
note on link
The difference progression is identical
to the modification difference.
